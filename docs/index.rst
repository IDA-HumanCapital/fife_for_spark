Finite-Interval Forecasting Engine for Apache Spark (FIFEforSpark)
##########################################

The Finite-Interval Forecasting Engine (FIFE) Python package provides machine learning and other models for discrete-time survival analysis and multivariate series forecasting. Why should you use the FIFE?

- Advanced machine learning methods that improve forecasting retention over traditional survival analysis
- Functionality for forecasting survival to a type of exit
- Functionality for forecasting the likelihood of being in a certain state in the future
- Command-line functionality for the binary retention model complete with graphs showing model metrics


FIFE for Spark is an extension of FIFE for the Apache Spark environment.

Project Information
===================

The Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) developed FIFE on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. Among other applications, FIFE is used to produce IDA's Retention Prediction Model.

FIFE has also been known as the Persistence Prediction Capability (PPC).

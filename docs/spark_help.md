# A guide to Spark

This document is intended to give a brief description of Spark, Pyspark, and the neccesity for creating a distributed version of FIFE. Next, we provide a tutorial for installing Spark and PySpark.
Following this, we provide a guide towards installing MMLSpark, which is a dependency for fifeforspark to run. Due to complications, MMLSpark could not be included in the batch file, and several caveats exist when attempting to download MMLSpark.

## What is Apache Spark?
A **cluster** is a collection of computers which are operated cohesively to perform a computation task.
Simply put, Apache Spark is a software language that supports cluster computation towards analytics tasks.

## What is PySpark?
While the original Apache Spark is written in Scala, PySpark extends Apache Spark functionality to Python. Neccessary for this is the Py4J package, which creates a Java virtual environment.

Where does Java come into all this?

## Spark and FIFE
Why is it neccessary?
